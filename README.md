# Projeto Google Search - CS50 Web Programming 👩🏻‍💻

<h3>Task: to design a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search.<h3>

<h4>Your website must meet the following requirements:<h4>

<h5>
-Your website should have at least three pages: one for regular Google Search (which must be called index.html), one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search.<br><br>
-On the Google Search page, there should be links in the upper-right of the page to go to Image Search or Advanced Search. On each of the other two pages, there should be a link in the upper-right to go back to Google Search.<br><br>
-On the Google Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search results for that page.<br><br>
-Like Google’s own, your search bar should be centered with rounded corners. The search button should also be centered, and should be beneath the search bar.<br><br>
-On the Google Image Search page, the user should be able to type in a query, click a search button, and be taken to the Google Image search results for that page.<br><br>
-On the Google Advanced Search page, the user should be able to provide input for the following four fields (taken from Google’s own advanced search options)<br><br>
.Find pages with… “all these words:”<br>
.Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”<br>
.Find pages with… “any of these words:”<br>
.Find pages with… “none of these words:”<br><br>
-Like Google’s own Advanced Search page, the four options should be stacked vertically, and all of the text fields should be left aligned.<br><br>
-Consistent with Google’s own CSS, the “Advanced Search” button should be blue with white text.<br><br>
-When the “Advanced Search” button is clicked, the user should be taken to the search results page for their given query.<br><br>
-Add an “I’m Feeling Lucky” button to the main Google Search page. Consistent with Google’s own behavior, clicking this link should take users directly to the first -Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.<br><br>
-You may encounter a redirect notice when using the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button. Not to worry! This is an expected consequence of a security feature implemented by Google.<br><br>
-The CSS you write should resemble Google’s own aesthetics.<br>
